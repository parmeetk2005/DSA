This repository contains my solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/PARMEET-KAUR/).  
I use this repo to **track my progress**, **practice data structures & algorithms**, and **prepare for coding interviews**.


## 📂 Structure
Each problem is stored by its ID and title for easy navigation:


## 🛠 Language Used
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-007396?logo=java&logoColor=white)
All solutions in this repository are implemented in **Java**, as it is the language I am most comfortable and efficient with.  
Using a single language ensures consistency and allows me to focus on problem-solving rather than switching between syntaxes.
